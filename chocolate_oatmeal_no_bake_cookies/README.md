# Ingredients

- 1 stick margarine
- 2 cups sugar
- ½ cup milk
- ¼ cup cocoa powder
- ½ cup peanut butter
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 2½ cups quick oats

# Directions

1. Melt margarine over medium heat in a 2qt saucepan.
1. Stir in sugar, milk, and cocoa.
1. Press out cocoa lumps as much as possible.
1. Bring to just boiling (when the whole surface starts bubbling).
1. Let boil for 3 minutes.
1. Remove from heat.
1. Stir in peanut butter, vanilla extract, and oats. The mixture should be fairly thick. If it seems runny, add ¼ cup oats.
1. Drop tablespoons onto wax paper and let cool until the cookies harden, about 30 minutes.

# Options

- For oatmeal raisin cookies, omit the cocoa powder and add ½ cup raisins (about 1 small box) along with the oats.

# Try next time

- Try less sugar, maybe 1½ cups.
- If making just for yourself, cut the recipe in half.
