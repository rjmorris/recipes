- 0.75 lb chicken tenders
- 15 oz can chickpeas (garbanzo beans), drained and rinsed
- 28 oz can diced tomatoes, drained
- 6 oz can tomato paste
- 1 medium yellow onion, chopped
- ⅓ cup fresh cilantro, chopped
- 1 tbsp garam masala
- 2 tsp garlic powder
- 1 tsp cumin
- ½ tsp cayenne
- ½ tsp coriander seeds
- ½ tsp turmeric

# Directions

1. Combine all ingredients in the crockpot.
1. Cook on HIGH for 2 hours.

# Serving Suggestions

- Serve over rice.
- Top with fresh cilantro.

# Options

- Replace the chicken with a second can of chickpeas. Without the chicken, there is more flexibility on cooking time/temperature. Can cook on LOW for 8 hours.
- If going with the vegetarian option, add a layer of cauliflower florets. It would also be helpful to add more liquid, such as water, coconut milk, or the juice from the canned tomatoes.
