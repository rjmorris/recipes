# Ingredients

- 1 lb chicken breasts
- 1 small onion, diced
- 1 can diced tomatoes, drained
- 1 cup coconut milk
- 4 tbsp peanut butter
- 1 tsp ground coriander
- 1 tsp cinnamon
- Â½ tsp red pepper flakes

# Directions

1. Stir the peanut butter and coconut milk until the peanut butter is dissolved.
1. Pour into a dutch oven.
1. Add the chicken, the spices, and the onion and tomatoes.
1. Bake at 350 for 45 minutes.

# Options

- Cook in the Instant Pot instead of the oven. Do not combine the peanut butter with the milk; instead, leave dollops of peanut butter on top. (Combining the peanut butter with the milk will likely make the sauce too thick and trigger the pot's "burn" error.) Cook on high pressure for 6 minutes and a natural release.
