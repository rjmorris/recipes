# Ingredients

- 1 bunch of collards
- ½ cup roughly chopped onion
- 1 tbsp sugar
- 2 tsp salt
- 1 tbsp worcestershire sauce
- 1 tbsp apple cider vinegar
- ½ tsp red pepper flakes
- water

# Directions

1. Prepare the greens by tearing them from the stems and cleaning them thoroughly. The greens from the grocery store are typically fairly clean to start with, but from the farmers' market they are likely to be very sandy. In that case, fill the sink with water and swish the greens around, draining and repeating until the the sand is removed and the water stays clear.
1. Add the greens to a large stock pot.
1. Add enough water to just cover the greens.
1. Add the remaining ingredients.
1. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and cover to simmer for 1-2 hours, stopping when the greens are tender.
