# Ingredients

- 2 cups yellow self-rising corn meal mix
- 1¼ cups milk
- 1 egg, beaten
- ¼ cup shortening

# Directions

1. Heat oven to 400.
1. Place shortening in 8x8 pan and melt it in the oven while pre-heating. It should melt in just a couple minutes, before the oven reaches 400.
1. Remove the pan from the oven.
1. Add the corn meal to a mixing bowl. Pour in the hot shortening, the milk, and the egg.
1. Whisk until combined.
1. Pour mixture back into 8x8 pan.
1. Bake for 20-30 minutes.

# Options

- Consider using vegetable oil instead of shortening. Coat the 8x8 pan with oil and put it in the oven while pre-heating. Add ¼ cup (unheated) oil to the mixing bowl. This should be easier than melting the shortening and pouring it into the mixing bowl. And I'm more likely to have oil on hand.
- Add chopped jalepenos or maybe other vegetables like onion, bell peppers, or carrots.
