# Ingredients

- 2 cups yellow self-rising corn meal mix
- 1¼ cups milk
- 1 egg, beaten
- ¼ cup oil or shortening

# Directions

1. Beat an egg in a mixing bowl. Add the milk and corn meal.
1. Heat oven to 400.
1. Add the oil or shortening to an 8x8 pan and place it in the oven while pre-heating. Leave it in for a couple minutes, long enough to get hot (or melt, if using shortening). It shouldn't need to stay in the oven for the entire pre-heating period.
1. Pour the hot oil or shortening into the bowl with the corn meal.
1. Whisk until combined.
1. Pour mixture back into 8x8 pan.
1. Bake for 20-30 minutes.

# Options

- Add chopped vegetables such as jalepenos, onion, bell peppers, or carrots.

# Try next time

- Don't bother heating the oil before whisking it into the batter. I think the pre-heating step is necessary only when using the shortening, because it needs to be a liquid to mix into the batter. So the procedure would go something like:

    1. Pre-heat the oven but not the 8x8 pan.
    1. Coat the pan with oil.
    1. Add the room temperature ¼ cup of oil while mixing the milk and corn meal.
    1. Pour the batter into the pan.
    1. Place the pan in the oven.

- Use half as much oil.
