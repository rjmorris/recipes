# Options

Add other vegetables to the quinoa, such as diced bell pepper.

Roast some butternut squash along with the Brussels sprouts. The squash may take about 15 minutes longer than the sprouts, so start those earlier.

Roast some pecans along with the Brussels sprouts. The pecans should take less than 5 minutes, so start those after removing the sprouts and check them soon after.

Top with feta cheese.
