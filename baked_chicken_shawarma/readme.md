# Ingredients

- 1 lb chicken tenders
- half of a red onion
- juice from 1 lemon
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- 2 tsp ground cumin
- 2 tsp paprika
- ½ tsp turmeric
- ¼ tsp cinnamon
- ½ tsp salt
- 1 tsp black pepper

## Sides

- rice
- tomatoes, cumumber, Kalamata olives

# Directions

1. Whisk lemon juice, olive oil, garlic, and spices in an 8x8 dish.
1. Add chicken and toss to coat.
1. Cover with foil and refrigerate for 1-4 hours.
1. Cut onion into large slices and place on top of chicken.
1. Cover and cook at 350 for 30 minutes.

# Serving Suggestions

- Serve over rice.
- Serve with a salad of tomatoes, cucumbers, and olives.

# Options

- Add thinly sliced carrots at the same time the onions are added. They'll need to be pretty thin to avoid being too hard after 30 minutes of baking.
- Instead of the tomato/cucumber/olive side salad, add cherry tomatoes and olives at the same time the onions are added.
