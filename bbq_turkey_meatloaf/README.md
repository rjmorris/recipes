Original recipe: [http://www.skinnykitchen.com/recipes/barbeque-turkey-meatloaf/](http://www.skinnykitchen.com/recipes/barbeque-turkey-meatloaf/)

# Ingredients

- 1 lb ground turkey (99% lean may be too dry, so look for something less, like 94%)
- 1 small yellow onion, chopped (about 1 cup)
- ½ cup BBQ sauce (a little less if the sauce is thin), plus more to spread on top
- 2 tbsp worcestershire sauce
- ½ cup plain breadcrumbs or oatmeal
- 1 egg, beaten
- ¼ tsp salt
- fresh ground black pepper, to taste

# Directions

1. By hand, mix all ingredients in a loaf pan. (It's easier to mix in a separate bowl, but this way avoids dirtying a separate bowl with raw turkey.)
1. Bake at 350 for 1 hour. Let stand 5 minutes.
1. Top with additional BBQ sauce before serving.
