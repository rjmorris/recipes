# Ingredients

- 1 lb ground turkey (99% lean may be too dry, so look for something less, like 94%)
- 1 small yellow onion, chopped (about 1 cup)
- ½ cup BBQ sauce, plus more to spread on top
- 2 tbsp worcestershire sauce
- ½ cup plain breadcrumbs
- 2 eggs, beaten
- ¼ tsp salt
- fresh ground black pepper, to taste

# Directions

1. Line a baking pan with foil.
1. By hand, mix all ingredients in a large bowl.
1. Place the mixture in the pan and shape into a loaf in the middle of the pan.
1. Spread additional BBQ sauce over top of loaf.
1. Bake at 350 for 1 hour. Let stand 5 minutes before serving.

# Options

1. Omit the breadcrumbs.
1. Replace the breadcrumbs with oats or corn flake crumbs.
1. Cook in a loaf pan instead of forming a loaf on a regular pan. The purpose of forming a loaf on a regular pan is to allow the excess fat to drain into the pan instead of soaking into the loaf. However, when I used a regular pan, I didn't see any excess fat outside the loaf anyway.
