Original recipe: https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/15880/key-lime-pie-vii

# Ingredients

- 9" prepared graham cracker crust
- A little less than two 14 oz cans of sweetened condensed milk (about 1¾ cans). The fat free variety is acceptable.
- ½ cup low fat sour cream. This is about half of an 8 oz container.
- ¾ cup key lime juice
- 1 tbsp lime zest

# Directions

1. Combine condensed milk, sour cream, lime juice, and lime zest in a medium bowl and whisk by hand or use an electric mixer.
1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees with the crust in it. Allow the crust to bake at 350 for about 3 minutes.
1. Remove the crust from the oven, and pour the filling into it. The filling will likely reach the top of the crust.
1. Bake for 12 minutes. Take it out earlier if you see pinhole bubbles burst on the surface of the pie.
1. Chill overnight before serving.

# Suggestions

If the crust comes with a plastic protector, flip it over and attach it to the pie tin to protect the pie during transport.
