# Ingredients

- 9" prepared graham cracker crust
- 3 cups fat free sweetened condensed milk (a little less than two 14 oz cans)
- ½ cup low fat sour cream (about half of a 8 oz container)
- ¾ cup key lime juice
- 1 tbsp lime zest

# Directions

1. Combine condensed milk, sour cream, lime juice, and lime zest in a medium bowl and mix well.
1. Pour into the crust. The filling should very nearly reach the top of the crust.
1. Bake in a preheated 350 degree oven for 12 minutes. Take it out earlier if you see pinhole bubbles burst on the surface of the pie.
1. Chill overnight before serving.

# Suggestions

If the crust comes with a plastic protector, flip it over and attach it to the pie tin to protect the pie during transport.
