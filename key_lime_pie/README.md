Original recipe: https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/15880/key-lime-pie-vii

# Ingredients

- 9" prepared graham cracker crust
- 14 oz can of sweetened condensed milk. The fat free variety is acceptable.
- 8 oz container of sour cream. The low fat variety is acceptable.
- ¾ cup key lime juice

# Directions

1. Combine condensed milk, sour cream and lime juice in a medium bowl and whisk by hand or use an electric mixer.
1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees with the crust in it. Allow the crust to bake at 350 for about 3 minutes.
1. Remove the crust from the oven, and pour the filling into it.
1. Bake for 12 minutes. Take it out earlier if you see pinhole bubbles burst on the surface of the pie.
1. Let cool for about an hour and then refrigerate.
1. Chill overnight before serving.

# Try next time

Drain the liquid from the sour cream and discard it. After removing a couple slices and letting the pie sit in the refrigerator for a few hours, liquid seeps into the hole where the slices had been. I suspect this might be coming from the sour cream. When making the egg version of this recipe, which uses egg yolks instead of sour cream, I didn't observe any liquid seepage. The egg version also used ½ cup instead of ¾ cup lime juice, so maybe that's where the excess liquid came from.

# Suggestions

If the crust comes with a plastic protector, flip it over and attach it to the pie tin to protect the pie during transport.

# Alternatives

Make a pudding instead of a pie by baking the filling in a 9x9 dish instead of in a pie crust.
