# Ingredients

- 1 medium head cauliflower, broken into florets
- 2 cans (14 oz each) diced tomatoes, undrained
- 2 cans (15 oz each) chickpeas, drained and rinsed
- 1 large onion, diced
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 inch ginger, peeled and minced
- 1 can (14 oz) light coconut milk
- 1 tbsp garam masala
- 2 tsp ground coriander
- 1 tsp ground cumin
- 1 tsp ground turmeric
- 2 tbsp olive oil

# Directions

1. Heat the oil in a Dutch oven over medium heat.
1. Saute the onion for 3 minutes or until soft.
1. Add the garlic and ginger and saute for 1 minute.
1. Add the spices and saute for 1 minute.
1. Stir in the coconut milk, tomatoes, chickpeas, and cauliflower.
1. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low.
1. Cover and simmer for 15 minutes or until cauliflower is tender.
1. Uncover and cook for 5 more minutes if the sauce needs to be thicker.

# Options

- This makes a lot, so much that it barely fits in my 2.75 qt Dutch oven. Consider using 1 can of chickpeas, 1 can of tomatoes, and less cauliflower, while keeping the rest the same.
- Replace the garam masala, coriander, cumin, and turmeric with 2 tbsp yellow curry.
