# Ingredients

- 3 cups chopped squash (about 2 small to medium squash)

- ½ stick margarine
- ½ cup water
- ¼ tsp salt
- ½ tsp pepper
- ½ cup milk
- 1 cup shredded sharp cheddar cheese
- 1½ cups crumbled low-sodium saltine crackers (about 1 sleeve)
    - alternative: ¾ cup bread crumbs
- 1 egg, beaten

# Directions

1. Cook squash, celery, onion, margarine, water, salt, and pepper in a 3qt saucepan for 5 minutes. Do not drain.

1. Pour into an 8x12 casserole dish.
1. Bake at 350 for 40 minutes.

# Options

- Grandma's version uses 1 stick of margarine, 2 eggs, and no salt. I suspect she used regular saltines instead of low sodium, though. Her version also replaces the ½ cup of milk with another ½ cup of water.
